Click on the Add Folder Icon from the top of the Explorer Menu.

Folders can be a helpful organizational tool when working with workflows in a chatbot development platform. By creating folders, you can group related workflows together and effectively manage and navigate through your workflow collection.

Here are some ways folders can help workflows:
1. **Organization and Structure**: Folders provide a logical structure to categorize and organize your workflows based on their purpose, functionality, or any other relevant criteria. This helps in maintaining a well-structured and easily understandable workflow hierarchy.
2. **Ease of Navigation**: As your collection of workflows grows, it can become challenging to locate specific workflows quickly. Folders allow you to group workflows into different categories, making it easier to find and access the desired workflow when you need it.
3. **Simplified Workflow Management**: With folders, you can perform actions on multiple workflows simultaneously. For example, you can move, copy, or delete entire folders, which in turn affects all the workflows contained within them. This saves time and effort when managing a large number of workflows.

### Workflows

Click on the Add Workflow Icon from the top of the Explorer Menu.

[Workflows](./workflows/) allow you to break down a complex chatbot into multiple smaller flows. Breaking down the chatbot into multiple flows makes it easier to maintain and reusable.

### Knowledge Base

Click on the Add Knowledge Base Icon from the top of the Explorer Menu.

The [Knowledge Base](./knowledge-base/) allows you to manage and access all your organizational knowledge in one place. You can upload various types of knowledge sources, including PDFs, static text, and website URLs.


### Tables

Click on the Add Table Icon from the top of the Explorer Menu.

[Tables](./tables/) in the explorer are essentially databases that you can leverage to store, organize, and manage data relevant to your chatbot's operation.

The data stored in tables can be queried and updated dynamically during chatbot conversations, providing a flexible and robust mechanism to handle complex scenarios that require data persistence or manipulation.
